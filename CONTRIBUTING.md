### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: someone who can develop new feature with any language.
- **qa-needed**: someone who can check the quality of this application, codes and so on.
- **documentation-needed**: someone who can help make any document(manual, how-to-use, etc.) for this application. 
- **bug-high-priority**: someone who can work for the bug-fix to next release.
- **bug-low-priority**: someone who can work for the bug-fix to future release.
- **help-wanted**: anyone can help me.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
